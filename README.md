# Chess Engine from Scratch

A modular chess engine written in C++ with a focus on clean architecture, object-oriented design, and efficient move generation. Built from the ground up to support future integration of AI-based decision-making using Minimax with alpha-beta pruning and a neural network evaluation function trained on real-world game data.

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Architecture**  
  Built using encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to promote modularity, scalability, and code clarity.

- **Efficient Core Engine**  
  Focused on clean formatting and optimized data structures to support fast, legal move generation and position evaluation.

  **AI Integration (Planned)**  
  - Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for game-tree exploration  
  - Neural network evaluator trained on the Lichess database to replace traditional evaluation functions and improve move selection.

- **Future Enhancements**  
  - Opening book support  
  - FEN parsing  
  - Move history tracking and undo/redo  
  - UCI protocol for GUI integration
