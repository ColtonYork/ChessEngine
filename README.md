# AI-Powered Chess Engine Interface

A C++ application designed to interpret and sign chess moves, making the game more accessible for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. This project combines core principles of software engineering with future plans to implement AI-driven decision-making and gesture interpretation.

## Features

-  Object-Oriented Design: Modular class architecture using encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to ensure extensibility and code clarity.
-  Clean Code & Efficiency: Prioritizes readable structure and efficient board representation for low-latency performance.
- AI Roadmap:  
  - Planned integration of a **Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning** for strategic move selection.
  - Future addition of a **neural network trained on Lichess.org data** to model player behavior and improve gameplay.
- Accessibility Focus: Designed to eventually output signed gestures corresponding to chess notation, expanding usability to non-verbal or hearing-impaired users.

## Technical Overview

- **Language:** C++  
- **Development Tools:** Visual Studio Code, Git  
- **Version Control:** GitHub (active repository)  
- **AI Models (Planned):** PyTorch / TensorFlow for neural network training (to be integrated into backend logic)
